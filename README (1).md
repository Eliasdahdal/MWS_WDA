## ▶️ Run Instructions

### 1. Start RabbitMQ

- **Via Docker (recommended):**
  ```bash
  docker run -d rabbitmq
  ```

- **Locally (if installed):**
  ```cmd
  net start RabbitMQ
  ```

> ⚠️ Ensure RabbitMQ path is added to the system environment variables if running locally.

---

### 2. Start the Services

Go to the `For Win-64` folder and **run these executables in order** (double-click each):

1. `UsersService.exe`
2. `ProductsService.exe`
3. `ProductsService2.exe`
4. `OrdersService.exe`
5. `PaymentsService.exe`
6. `ApiGateway.exe`

---

## 🔗 API Usage

Use tools like **Postman** or **Thunder Client** to send requests to the services via the **API Gateway**:  
`http://localhost:7000/gateway/`

> All requests **must** include the header:
```http
x-api-key: <your_api_key>
```

### 🔑 API Keys by Role

| Role   | Key    | Permissions               |
|--------|--------|---------------------------|
| Admin  | 99999  | Full access               |
| User   | 12345  | Limited access            |
| Guest  | 00000  | Create account & view only|

## ⚠️ Notes & Tips

- **RabbitMQ** is required for all service communication via publish-subscribe model.
- Requests without a valid `x-api-key` will receive a `401 Unauthorized` response.
- **All requests go through the API Gateway** – no need to access internal services directly.
- When creating an order (`POST /orders`), a log will appear in `PaymentsService` showing asynchronous message handling.
- Admins can view **all users**, while standard users can only view **their own info**.
- Repeated requests to `/products` may return different categories (e.g., electronics, perfumes) due to load balancing between `ProductsService` and `ProductsService2`.
